# JS Tetris

JS Tetris is a browser based clone of one of the greatest
puzzle video games of all time. JS Tetris is an open source project
founded by
[Czarek Tomczak](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17xmoT5Z_zTHkVclqPzrs2aAV64Uiu7fh/view)
in 2004. To play the game you only need to enable javascript
in your browser, there are no plugins required (no java,
no flush). You are free to put Js Tetris on your website
and to modify the game. The rules are simple: move and rotate the
blocks with the aim of creating a horizontal line of blocks
without gaps. Use arrows and spacebar keys to navigate blocks.


## Download

A browser version of the game is available for download. To run it, extract the
zip file and open tetris.html in your browser. Download it from
the [Releases page](../../releases).
